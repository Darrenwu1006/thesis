## Abstract

This research illuminates the experiences of second-generation Asian immigrants in the U.S., a rapidly growing demographic predicted to become the largest immigrant group by 2065. Despite sharing an Asian heritage, these individuals navigate between two contrasting cultures - the East and the West - shaping their self-identity and societal integration. The study aims to narrate their stories, elucidating their struggles with integration into American society, and their journey of identity formation that straddles their own and their parents' cultural norms. Methodology includes primary interviews, secondary memoir collections, interview transcripts, film clips, social media, and reviews to create a database of memories. Data will be categorized through machine learning techniques for labeling and classification, and emotion recognition technology in tandem with generative AI. This approach allows for the identification of key themes and words that connect various fragments of their memories. The ultimate objective is to provide visibility to their experiences and foster greater understanding among this marginal population.
