## Abstract

After 1965, the United States experienced its third wave of immigration, with over forty million new immigrants arriving in the country over the past fifty years and giving birth to subsequent generations. This wave of immigration was primarily composed of individuals of Central and South American as well as Asian descent. The median age of the second generation, now in their thirties, reflects the passage of time since the initial immigration.

As an Asian international student, I have had the opportunity to meet many second-generation immigrants during this period and hear their stories of growth. These experiences have ignited my motivation to explore the stories of second-generation Asian immigrants, focusing on their struggles with mobility and self-identity formation, and to articulate a collective memory belonging to third culture kids.

The definitions of second-generation immigrants and third culture kids can generally be summarized as follows: individuals whose parents possess passports from a country different from the one in which the second generation grew up. This research will be divided into three parts:

The first part will inventory demographic data to clarify the basic profile of second-generation Asian immigrants, including educational attainment, income, and comparisons across cities.

The second part will begin with various texts, collecting growth stories of third culture kids from books, movie scripts, and conducting semantic analysis. It will explore how these creators project their life trajectories onto their works, identifying common themes or scenes.

The third part will involve interviews and interactive questionnaires with several second-generation Asian immigrants.

Through these research methods, I hope to better understand their stories and convey them through this work. These second-generation immigrants are becoming increasingly important to the future of America, and their stories deserve to be heard by more people. I also hope to reassure these second-generation immigrants that they are not alone, and that this work can serve as a platform for them to explore and discuss their stories.
